Step 1:

First, you access the link above to download the heartbeat code folder and insert images to your computer. Next, we will extract the file as usual.


Step 2:

Next, to insert the image into the heart shape, you will move the image file to the same folder containing this heart code. So when editing the code, inserting images can be done.

Move the image to the heahe-beating code folder.

Step 3.

We will copy the image name and see what format the image is to insert into the code.

Copy image name

Step 4:

Right-click the index.html file and select Notepad to open it, or use the HTML file reader installed on your computer if you have one.

Open html file

Step 5:

We will proceed to edit the code to our liking. At EDIT HERE will edit the content shown in the heart. STARDUST1 can edit the year if desired.

At STARDUST2, you enter your name and that person. STARDUST3 can change Love You to another line depending on you.

The image line will fill in the name and format of the image to be inserted in the middle, as shown in the picture. Okay.

 Could you change the heartbeat code?

 Step 6:

 Finally, click File and select Save to save the result.

 Save new code

 As usual, you open the HTML file to see how the heartbeat code looks.
